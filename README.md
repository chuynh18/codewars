CodeWars solutions (and code fragments)
=======================================

This is where I post my CodeWars kata solutions.  Supporting code (mainly just code fragments I wrote to quickly test program subroutines) can be found inside folders.  Kata solutions just live at the root level.

* [advancedmorse.js](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54b72c16cd7f5154e9000457) - 4 kyu
* [calc.js](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5235c913397cbf2508000048) - 3 kyu
* [dicerollsprobability-pascalstriangle.js](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55d18ceefdc5aba4290000e5) - 4 kyu
    * You'll find code fragments and a brute force solver in the "for dicerollsprobability" folder.  The brute force solver is correct (and shares most of its code with the actual solution); it's just far too slow.
* [division.js](https://www.codewars.com/kata/598dba93700c2c0f470000dc) - 3 kyu
* [removecomments.js](https://www.codewars.com/kata/51c8e37cee245da6b40000bd) - 4 kyu
* [sumbignums.js](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5324945e2ece5e1f32000370) - 4 kyu
    * Kind of took advantage of there being [another kata that's almost exactly the same](https://www.codewars.com/kata/525f4206b73515bffb000b21).  I don't remember if the code in its current form can solve both.  It only took an incredibly minor revision, though (something about removing leading zeroes from the input numbers).
